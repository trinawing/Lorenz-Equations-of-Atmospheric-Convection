# Lorenz-Equations-of-Atmospheric-Convection
The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight. Written in Matlab.
